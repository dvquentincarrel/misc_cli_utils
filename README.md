## Purpose

A collection of some CLI/TUI utils I made over time

## Setting up
Running the `setup.sh` should be enough.  
The installation script puts the executable in your `~/.local/bin` dir by default.
You scan specify another directory as an argument like `./setup.sh ~/my_bins`.  
I do not guarantee it will work with names that contain spaces or special characters.
